**[Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/)**


Testing: GitHub Codespaces with Python, 
committing code to GithHub (ie. this repository)

## Day 1: Trebuchet (Searching Strings)

1. Part I search for first and last occurance of digit 1, 2, 3, ... 9 in string
2. Part II extends search to include digit names "one", "two", etc.
3. Note: "gotcha" must account for overlapping digit names ie. twoone => 21

## Day 2: Cube Conundrum (Split Strings)
1. Part I split string by ; , and " " to create totals for "5 red, 6 green, 7 blue" cubes
2. Part II modified totals with minimal change to Part I.
3. note: AI "gotcha" autofilled red, green, and blue counts in RBG order rather then RGB
4. AI is able to generate accurate description of code written (see comments in [day2a.py](/day02/day2a.py))
